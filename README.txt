JREXML is an add-on for JRuby that uses a Java pull parser library to speed up REXML.

REXML is, unfortunately, painfully slow running under JRuby at the moment due to the slowness of regular expression parsing. JREXML shoves a small wrapper around XPP3/MXP1 (http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/xgws/xsoap/xpp/mxp1/) into the guts of REXML, disabling the regular expression parser and providing close to a 10x speedup.

== Install

Simply install the gem under JRuby:

    jruby -S gem install jrexml

And require 'jrexml' to speed up REXML.

    gem 'jrexml'
    require 'jrexml'

== Source

You can get the JREXML source using Git, in any of the following ways:

    git clone git://git.caldersphere.net/jrexml.git
    git clone http://git.caldersphere.net/jrexml.git
    git clone git://github.com/nicksieger/jrexml.git
